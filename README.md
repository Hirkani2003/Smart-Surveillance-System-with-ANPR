# Smart-Surveillance-System-with-ANPR

The proposed project aims at creating a security surveillance system that will use vehicle license plate recognition technology and an automated gate control system 
using ESP8266 that will help to make it more efficient and secure at the entrance of all critical locations where protection and security are inevitable. 
In the proposed system, the gate works automatically without any human intervention, and the system can also recognize the license plate of the vehicle at the 
entrance gate to decide whether or not to let the vehicle in.
